Test Project Based on Animations.

This project focuses on animations, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to make the animations as clean and smooth as possible.

For simplicity, I have chosen not to add much interaction on other pages like "HOME", "CARROS", and "FALE CONOSCO" for now. However, I might complete these sections in the near future.

There's no problem using the code, because its more visual than anything.

In a future, im looking foward to add some database and more interactions, with more cars etc
